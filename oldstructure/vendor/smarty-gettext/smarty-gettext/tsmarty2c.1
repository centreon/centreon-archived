.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
'nh
.fi
.ad l
\fBtsmarty2c\fR <templ-file1-or-dir1> \\
          [<templ-file2-or-dir2>] \\
          [... <templ-fileN-or-dirN>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtsmarty2c\fR rips the translation strings from smarty template files,
and converts them to gettext calls in C.
.PP
The C output may later be used with the standard gettext tools (see xgettext).
.PP
If one of the parameters is a directory, the template files within will
be parsed, recursively.
.PP
The output also contains comments that point to the location of the file 
that the string has been ripped from.
.PP
You can use the '--add-comments' parameter of xgettext to make it include
these comments inside the PO file (suggested by Mike van Lammeren).
