Medias
======

Medias are images used by the Centreon web interface.
These images are used to represent the monitored resource in a more intuitive way, propose backgrounds for cartography modules, etc.

****************
Image management
****************

All the images are stored in the folder entitled: **/usr/share/Centreon/www/img/media** of the Centreon server.

There are two methods for adding images to this folder:

* Do it manually
* Use automatic synchronisation: this method has the advantage of being able to import multiple images at the same time.

Manual addition
===============

To add an image in Centreon:

#. Go into the menu: **Administration** ==> **Options**
#. In the left menu, click on **Media**
#. Click on **Add**

The following window is displayed:

   :align: center

* **Existing or new directory** field can be used to add a new folder in the image folder or to choose an existing folder into which the image can be copied
* **Image or archive** field can be used to select the image or the set of images contained in an archive which will be imported
* **Comments** field can be used to describe the image

Synchronising the images
========================

To synchronise one or more images in the Centreon medias:

#. Copy your images in the image folder (the images may be situated in folders)
#. Make sure that the user who executes your web server has the read rights on these images
#. Go into the menu: **Administration** ==> **Options**
#. In the left menu, click on **Media**
#. Click on **Synchronize Media Directory**

The following window imports the new images:
