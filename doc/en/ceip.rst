Joining the Centreon Customer Experience Improvement Program

***************************************
Customer Experience Improvement Program
***************************************

Centreon is continually striving to understand and anticipate our users needs in order to deliver world-class products
and solutions. The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) will deliver benefits to our users by allowing us to
understand how you use our software, so that we can provide you with a continuous enhancement of your Centreon software
experience. The program has two components:

* A simple telemetry
* Advanced statistics on the use of the Centreon software suite

Telemetry anonymously and automatically collects the following data:

* Information such as the operating system version of the Centreon main server of the platform as well as the name and
  version of the DBMS.
* Centreon product information such as number of servers and version numbers of components installed on the Centreon
  main server (modules & widgets).
* Centreon information such as number of hosts, services, groups of hosts & services, and usage of modules and widgets.
* The timezone of the Centreon server.

Advanced statistics include the use of additional components such as the use of widgets in custom views, slot
management for Centreon DSM, use of deployed Plugin Packs, and more.

What will Centreon do with the information that is collected?
=============================================================

The information collected will be used to better understand how customers use
Centreon products, and how to improve Centreon products by fixing issues and
delivering the most useful new features in a much more streamlined manner.

Is the collected information anonymous?
=======================================

YES! Moreover, Centreon takes all necessary precautions to protect the security of the
information that is collected, transmitted and stored. We only collect data of
Centreon product(s). The program takes only those actions described on this page,
and only if you decide to participate. This program cannot collect information
without your full knowledge or consent.

How does the Centreon Experience Improvement Program work?
==========================================================

This is an automated process that requires no effort to participate. It is
transparent to users. Customers simply choose to participate, granting
Centreon permission to securely receive anonymous data.

Will I receive spam if I participate in the program?
====================================================

You will not receive any e-mail from Centreon about this program, regardless
of whether or not you participate. We do not collect personal
information as part of this program that will be used to identify you or contact
you.

Do I need an Internet connection?
=================================

An internet connection is required to participate in this program. However, you
do not need to be connected all the time. When an internet connection becomes
available, the information is automatically transmitted with minimal impact to
your connection.

Can I see the data that is collected before it is sent to Centreon?
===================================================================

No, the information cannot be displayed. This program is designed to work for
thousands of users without affecting their product use, so the data is sent
automatically. The data is also encoded and compressed so that it can be
processed efficiently.

How long does the program last?
===============================

Information is collected as long as you use the product version for which you
have agreed to participate or until you decide to stop participating in the
program.

What is the anonymous installation ID used for?
===============================================
Upon the first startup of the Centreon server, a random number is generated:
the anonymous installation ID.
