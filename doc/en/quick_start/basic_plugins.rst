Basic Plugin Packs
==================

Centreon is a highly versatile monitoring solution that can be configured to
meet the specific needs of your IT infrastructure. To quickly configure
Centreon and help you get started, you may want to use Centreon IMP. This tool
provides you with Plugin Packs, which are bundled configuration templates that
will dramatically reduce the time needed to implement the Centreon platform for
monitoring the services in your network.

Go to the **Configuration > Plugin Packs** menu.

.. note::
    Configure :ref:`the proxy<impproxy>` to allow the Centreon server to access
    the Internet.

Install the **base-generic** Plugin Pack by moving your cursor on it and by
clicking on **+** icon:

Now you have the basic templates and plugins to initial monitoring!

Install other Plugin Packs you probably need for your environment, for **Linux
SNMP** and **Windows SNMP** available for free:
