Core components upgrade
=======================

Stop Centreon components
************************

.. warning::
    Before to start the update, check if you don't have any Centreon-Broker retention files.

Stop Centreon Broker and Centreon Engine on **all poller**::

   # service centengine stop
   # service cbd stop

Update components
*****************

In order to update the Centreon monitoring interface, simply run the following command:

 ::

 # yum update centreon

.. warning::
   If you encounter dependency problems with centreon-engine-webservices, please remove this RPM that is now deprecated. Run the following line:
   # yum remove centreon-engine-webservices

If you come from Centreon 2.7.0-RC2, in order to avoid the rpm naming problem please launch the following command line:

  ::

  # yum downgrade centreon-2.7.0 centreon-plugins-2.7.0 centreon-base-config-centreon-engine-2.7.0 centreon-plugin-meta-2.7.0 centreon-common-2.7.0 centreon-web-2.7.0 centreon-trap-2.7.0 centreon-perl-libs-2.7.0


Restart web server
******************

Due to the installation of PHP-intl it is necessary to restart the Apache web server
to load new extension.

   # service httpd restart
   
Update poller
*************

Repeat this procedure on all your poller :

EMS/EPP upgrade
===============

.. note::
   Not a EMS/EPP user ? You might still find Centreon Plugin Packs very
   useful to configure your monitoring system in minutes. You will find
   installation guidance in the :ref:`online documentation <installation_ppm>`.


If you use additional Centreon modules you might need to update them too,
for them to work properly with your new Centreon version. This is
particularly true for EMS/EPP users.

.. warning::
   In this case you need to contact our Support that will give you the link to set up the new repo for each module.
   If you're using Centreon BAM, you must have the great repo to upgrade your Centreon.
   The following option should not be used :
   # --skip-broken

Repository update
*****************

Just like for Centreon ISO, the .repo file needs to be updated to use the 3.4
release. Please ask Centreon support team if you do not know how to
perform this operation.

Package update
**************

Run the following command on your central server to update Centreon
Plugin Pack Manager, the Plugin Packs and their associated plugins.

::

   # yum update centreon-pp-manager ces-plugins-* ces-pack-*


You will also need to run the following command on every poller using
the Plugin Packs.

::

   # yum update ces-plugins-*


Web update
**********

You now need to run the web update manually. For this purpose, go to
Administration -> Extensions -> Modules.

.. image:: /_static/images/upgrade/ppm_1.png
   :align: center

Install Centreon License Manager (PPM dependency) and update Centreon
Plugin Pack Manager.
