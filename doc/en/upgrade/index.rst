This chapter describes how to upgrade your Centreon monitoring platform.

This procedure is linked to your initial version of Centreon. You will have to
**use packages** if you already installed using Centreon ISO or an RPM, and
source files if you installed from sources. Before upgrading Centreon, remember
to make a backup your system.

.. warning::
    If you try to migrate a platform using **Centreon Poller Display 1.6.x**,
    refer to :ref:`migration procedure <migratefrompollerdisplay>`.
