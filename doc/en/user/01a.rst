The list of new features is available at the following addresses:

*	`Forge Centreon <https://forge.centreon.com/projects/centreon/roadmap>`_
*	`Forge Centreon Engine <https://forge.centreon.com/projects/centreon-engine/roadmap>`_
*	`Forge Centreon Broker <https://forge.centreon.com/projects/centreon-broker/roadmap>`_

Why choose Centreon Engine and Broker ?
==================================================

Performances
------------
The tests carried out by the MERETHIS teams and some independent users show clearly that the Centreon Engine and Centreon Broker pair performs 8 to 9 times better than the Nagios/NDOUtils pair.

Better  integration into Centreon
---------------------------------
The Centreon web interface is more and more oriented towards the use of Centreon Broker. Here are a few examples:

* There is a configuration assistant for Centreon Broker
* Display performance is greatly improved
* Some selection filters are only available with the Centreon Broker
* The next major version of Centreon will no longer support the Nagios / NDOUtils pair

New features
------------
Several new features make their appearance with Centreon Broker:

* Possibility of encrypting supervision data transmitted to the central server
* Possibility of compressing supervision data to avoid overloading the bandwidth
* Use of a new data encrypting protocol (the BBDO protocol) which is more efficient than the NDO protocol
* Possibility of filtering the type of stream between the components of Centreon Broker to reduce the load and the bandwidth
* Possibility unidirectional flow between the  Centreon server and its collectors (e.g.: only LAN flows to  DMZ )

.. note::

 This information is based on the assumption that all optimisations have been performed for Centreon Engine, that the transactions have been enabled in Centreon Broker and that the optimisations have been performed for MariaDB.

 If not virtualized architecture, a minimum CPU frequency of 2.5 GHz is recommended.

 Central server load depends on the number of simultaneous users, the content of pages visited and the refresh rate of the pages. Our studies were performed with 15 simultaneous users on the monitoring page and with 60 s of cooling.

Introduction to the web interface
=================================


Centreon web interface is made up of several menus, each menu has a specific function:

.. image :: /images/user/amenu.png
   :align: center

|

*       The **Home** menu enables access to the first home screen after logging in. It summarises the general status of the supervision.
*       The **Monitoring** menu contains the status of all the supervised elements in real and delayed time via the viewing of logs.
*       The **Views** menu serves to view and configured the performances graphics for each element in the  information system.
*       The **Reporting** menu serves to view, intuitively (via diagrams), the evolution of the supervision on a given period.
*	The **Configuration** menu serves to configure all monitored objects and the supervision infrastructure.
*       The **Administration** menu serves to configure the Centreon web interface and to view the general status of the servers.

Before going further
====================

it is necessary update the CES 3.1 server. To do this:

 #.	Log in as a ‘root’ on the central server
 #.	Enter this command

::

    yum -y update

Allow the update to run fully and then restart the server in case of a kernel update.
