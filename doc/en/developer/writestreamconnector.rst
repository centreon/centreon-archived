How to write a Stream Connector
===============================

********
Overview
********

Centreon Stream Connector is a feature introduced in Centreon 3.4.6. It allows
one to export Centreon data (events and metrics) to an external storage or
application such as ElasticSearch, Splunk, InfluxDB, files, etc.

In a Centreon platform, the component that carries information between the
remote pollers and the Centreon central server is called Centreon Broker. This
broker stores received data into the Centreon local storage: MariaDB and
RRDtool.

The following diagram explains the transfer of collected data and insertion into
storages:

The Stream Connector functionality is a new Centreon Broker output getting data
from Centreon Broker Master (also known as Centreon Broker SQL) to aggregate and
forward it to external storage:

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/lua/archi_broker_stream.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 65%

This output loads a Lua script called a Stream Connector, which job is to
handle, aggregate and enrich the data before forwarding it to the defined
protocol:

   :align: center
   :scale: 65%

Because it is an output of Centreon Broker, the principle of creating retention
files upon interrupting external storage access is retained. In the same way,
it is possible to filter input on the categories of flow to handle.

************
Requirements
************

To use the Centreon Stream connector functionality you need to update your Centreon
platform to Centreon 3.4.6:

* Centreon Web >= 2.8.18
* Centreon Broker >= 3.0.13
* Lua >= 5.1.x

*************************
Creating a new Lua script
*************************

The complete technical documentation is available `here <https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-broker/en/latest/exploit/stream_connectors.html>`_.
In this how-to, we will write two scripts:

* The first one, easy, that explains the basics of Stream Connectors. Its goal
  is to export data to a log file.
* The second one is more exigent for the reader, it exports performance data
  to the TSDB InfluxDB but is easily adaptable to export to another TSDB.

Programming language
====================

Centreon chose the Lua programming language to let you handle, aggregate and
transfer data. Lua is a programming language that is easy to use. You can find
more information with the `Lua official documentation <https://www.lua.org/docs.html>`_

Storage of Lua scripts
======================
Broker's Lua scripts can be stored in any directory readable by the
**centreon-broker** user.

We recommend to store them in **/usr/share/centreon-broker/lua**.

.. note::
   In a near future, this directory will be in the *default path* of the Lua
   scripts launched by broker. It will then be easier to use user defined
   Lua libraries because you will just have to add your libraries there like
   stream connectors.

Write all information into a file
=================================

Store raw data
**************

Let's start with the first script. Our goal is to store all events
given by Broker in a log file. We will call our stream connector
**bbdo2file.lua**.

As we said previously, we will store this file into the
**/usr/share/centreon-broker/lua** directory on the Centreon central server.

If the directory does not exist, as root, we can create it with the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir -p /usr/share/centreon-broker/lua

Centreon Broker provides several log functions to write logs, warnings or errors
into a file. We will use one of these functions *info()* to write Broker events.
`See technical documentation for more information
<https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-broker/en/latest/exploit/stream_connectors.html#the-broker-log-object>`_.

The function *info()* makes part of the *broker_log* object. To call it, the
syntax is the following:

.. code-block:: lua

  broker_log:info(level, text)

* *level* is an integer from 1 (most important) to 3 (least important).
* *text* is the text to write as log.

.. note::
  Did you notice the separator between **broker_log** and **info**, yes it is a
  colon! Objects functions, also called *methods* are called like this in Lua.

Let's start our script. The more important function in a stream connector is
the **write()** function. Each time an event is received from a poller through
Broker, this function is called with the event as an argument.

.. note::
  You will never have to call the **write()** function by yourself, it is always
  Broker's work to do so. And it would be a fault to make such a call. In other
  words, there should not be any call to the **write()** function in your script.

`See technical documentation for more information
<https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-broker/en/latest/exploit/stream_connectors.html#the-write-function>`_.

Here is the **bbdo2file.lua** first version:

.. code-block:: lua

  function init(conf)
    broker_log:set_parameters(3, "/var/log/centreon-broker/bbdo2file.log")
  end

  function write(d)
    for k,v in pairs(d) do
      broker_log:info(3, k .. " => " .. tostring(v))
    end
    return true
  end

.. note::
   Information about the initialization of the Broker's log function
   and its parameters are given here `see technical documentation <https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-broker/en/latest/exploit/stream_connectors.html#the-broker-log-object>`_.

Let's explain what we are doing in this script.

We must provide an **init()** function, it is described in the `technical documentation <https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-broker/en/latest/exploit/stream_connectors.html#the-init-function>`_.

This function is called during the stream connector initialization.
Here, we use it to initialize the **broker_log** object. To achieve this,
we call the **broker_log::set_parameters()** method that needs two parameters :

* A max level (from 1 to 3). If you give 2 here, only logs of levels 1 and 2
  will be returned.
* A file to write the logs in. This file must be in a writable directory for
  the **centreon-broker** user.

The second function is the **write()** function. We already said its argument
is a Broker event. This type of object is a collection of keys/values. For example:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "check_hosts_freshness": false,
    "active_host_checks": true,
    "category": 1,
    "event_handlers": true,
    "instance_id": 1,
    "last_command_check": 1522836592,
    "type": 65552,
    "global_service_event_handler": "",
    "obsess_over_services": false,
    "passive_service_checks": true,
    "last_alive": 1522836593,
    "active_service_checks": true,
    "check_services_freshness": true,
    "flap_detection": false,
    "global_host_event_handler": "",
    "notifications": true,
    "obsess_over_hosts": false,
    "passive_host_checks": true,
    "element": 16
  }

In all events, you will find *category*, *element* and *type*.

* Information about the *category* can be found `here in the bbdo documentation <https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon-broker/en/latest/dev/bbdo.html#event-categories>`_
* The *element* is the *sub-category* (also called *type* in the bbdo
  documentation).
* The *type* is a number built from the *category* and the *element* (binary
  concatenation).

In this example, the *category* is 1 and the *element* is 16. So, by reading
the documentation, we can say this event is a NEB event with sub-category
*instance-status*.

To finish with the **write()** function, we make a loop on the **d** event
parameters. For each step, *k* is a key and *v* is the corresponding value.
And we send to the log file a string `k .. " => " .. tostring(v)` that means
the *concatenation* of *k*, *=>* and *v* converted into a string. You will see
an example of the result below.

Another possibility would be to use the **broker.json_encode(d)** function that
converts any Lua object to a *json* string representation of it. So, we could
write the function like this:

.. code-block:: lua

  function write(d)
    broker_log:info(3, broker.json_encode(d))
    return true
  end

.. note::

  You can notice that **broker.json_encode(d)** is made of **broker** and
  **json_encode(d)** separated by a *dot* and not a *colon*. This is because
  **broker** is not a Lua object. In fact, you can see it as a functions set
  provided by *Centreon Broker*.

Once your file **/usr/share/centreon-broker/lua/bbdo2file.lua** is ready, verify
it is readable by the **centreon-broker** user (or the **centreon-engine**
user who is the owner of the **centreon-broker** group), if it is not the case,
as root you can enter::

  # chown centreon-engine:centreon-engine /usr/share/centreon-broker/lua/bbdo2file.lua

Then configure the new output into Centreon Web interface in
**Configuration > Pollers > Broker configuration > Central Broker**. In **Output**
tab select **Generic – Stream connector** and click **Add**:

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/lua/add_stream_connector.png
   :align: center

Define the name of this output and the path to the Lua connector:

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/lua/describe_output.png
   :align: center

Then click **Save** and go to generate the configuration and restart **cbd**.

Once the Centreon Broker will be restarted on your Centreon central server, data
will appear in your **/var/log/centreon-broker/bbdo2file.log** log file::

.. note::
   This log file will grow quickly, do not forget to add a log rotate.

Use parameters
**************

The Centreon Broker log functions should be used for log only. To write into a
file, we must use the Lua dedicated function. Moreover, it is possible to use
parameters to define the name of the log file.

So it is time to improve our Stream Connector:

.. code-block:: lua

  function init(conf)
    logFile = conf['logFile']
    broker_log:set_parameters(3, "/var/log/centreon-broker/debug.log")
  end

  function writeIntoFile(output)
    local file,err = io.open(logFile, 'a')
    if file == nil then
      broker_log:info(3, "Couldn't open file: " .. err)
    else
      file:write(output)
      file:close()
    end
  end

  function write(d)
    for k,v in pairs(d) do
      writeIntoFile(k .. " => " .. tostring(v) .. "\n")
    end
    return true
  end


Did you notice that expression `local file,err = io.open(logFile, 'a')`?

Lua is able to store several variables at the same time. Also, Lua functions can
return several variables!

For example, if you want to swap variables *a* and *b*, you can enter:

.. code-block:: lua

  a, b = b, a

Another example that illustrates several values returned:

.. code-block:: lua

  function fib(a, b)
    return b, a + b
  end

So, this call to **io.open** returns two variables, a first variable
**file** that is a *file descriptor* used to access the file and a second
variable not always defined that contains error if one occurs or **nil**
(not defined) otherwise.

The **init()** function allows to get parameters and define these from Centreon
web interface. See technical documentation for more information. Here, we add
the possibility to choose the destination file name. The **conf** table has
a key *logFile* defined in the web interface. The corresponding value is
the file name used to store events.

Edit your Broker output to declare this parameter:

.. image:: /_static/images/developer/lua/add_parameter.png
   :align: center

It is important that the name of the parameter in the web interface matches the
key name in the **conf** table. Here, it is *logFile*.

Then click **Save** and go to generate the configuration and restart **cbd**.

Data are stored into **/var/log/centreon-broker/bbdo2file.log** log file as
this::

  name => error
  category => 3
  interval => 300
  rrd_len => 3456000
  value => 0
  value_type => 0
  type => 196612
  ctime => 1522315660
  index_id => 4880
  element => 4
  state => 0
  category => 3
  interval => 300
  rrd_len => 3456000
  is_for_rebuild => false
  service_id => 1056
  type => 196609
  ctime => 1522315660
  host_id => 145
  element => 1
  is_for_rebuild => false
  metric_id => 11920

Manipulate data
***************

Here, we continue to improve our stream connector by choosing what events to
export and also by improving outputs.

We will select only the NEB category and the events regarding hosts and
services status.

We know that NEB is the category 1, also service status is the sub-category 24,
whereas host status is the sub-category 14.

So, only events with the following criteria:

* category = 1
* element = 14 or element = 24

are interesting for us.

Moreover, we would prefer to have a host name instead of a host id and a service
description instead of a service id.

At last, we would be interested to get status information and outputs.

NEB Events with elements 14 and 24 give almost all we want except host names and
service descriptions.

To get those two information, we will have to use the **broker_cache** object.
This one is filled when pollers are restarted or reloaded. So, do not forget
to restart your pollers if you want something in your **broker_cache** object!

If the cache is well filled, it is easy to get a host name from the host id::

  broker_cache:get_hostname(host_id)

And it is also easy to get the service description from the host id and service
id::

  broker_cache:get_service_description(host_id, service_id)

To install the filter on events, there is a useful function called **filter()**
that takes two parameters into account: *category*, *element*.

This function, if defined, is called just before **write()**. If it returns
**true**, the **write()** function will be called, otherwise, the event will
be thrown away.

Let's complete our Lua script:

.. code-block:: lua

  function init(conf)
    logFile = conf['logFile']
    broker_log:set_parameters(3, "/var/log/centreon-broker/debug.log")
  end

  local function writeIntoFile(output)
    local file,err = io.open(logFile, 'a')
    if file == nil then
      broker_log:info(3, "Couldn't open file: " .. err)
    else
      file:write(output)
      file:close()
    end
  end

  function write(d)
    local output = ""

    local host_name = broker_cache:get_hostname(d.host_id)
    if not host_name then
      broker_log:info(3, "Unable to get name of host, please restart centengine")
      host_name = d.host_id
    end

    if d.element == 14 then
      output = "HOST:" .. host_name .. ";" .. d.host_id .. ";" .. d.state .. ";" .. d.output
      writeIntoFile(output)
      broker_log:info(output)
    elseif d.element == 24 then
      local service_description = broker_cache:get_service_description(d.host_id, d.service_id)
      if not service_description then
        broker_log:info(3, "Unable to get description of service, please restart centengine")
        service_description = d.service_id
      end
      output = "SERVICE:" .. host_name .. ";" .. d.host_id .. ";" .. service_description .. ";" .. d.service_id .. ";" .. d.state .. ";" .. d.output
      writeIntoFile(output)
      broker_log:info(output)
    end
    return true
  end

  function filter(category, element)
    -- Get only host status and services status from NEB category
    if category == 1 and (element == 14 or element == 24) then
      return true
    end
      return false
  end



Just several remarks on this new script before showing what we get.

In the **init()** function, we access the *logFile* key in the *conf* table
by using `conf['logFile']`. Whereas, in the **write()** function, we access
the *element* key in the *d* table by using `d.element`...

In fact, the two syntaxes are allowed : `d.element` is the same value than
`d['element']`.

Another remark, in the **write()** function we can see something like::

  if not host_name then

And in the **writeIntoFile()** function, we can see that::

  if file == nil then

Do they mean the same thing? Where is the difference?

You must know that in Lua, a variable is considered to be **true** if it is
defined and not **false**:

so, the following code

.. code:: lua

  if toto then
    print("Good")
  else
    print("Bad")
  end

will write *Good* if *toto* is defined and not **false**. More precisely, it will
write *Good* in the following cases:

* toto=12
* toto=true
* toto="A string"
* toto=0 (surprising!)

It will write *Bad* in these cases:

* toto=nil (by default a variable is nil, which means not defined)
* toto=false

The **/var/log/centreon-broker/bbdo2file.log** file will now contain::

***********************************
Export performance data to InfluxDB
***********************************

Now, you have already seen many things about stream connectors. It is time to
create something more useful!

`InfluxDB <https://www.influxdata.com/>`_ is a Time Series database. We will use
this storage to insert performance data collected by the Centreon platform. For
this example, we will use the predefined `InfluxDB Docker <https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/>`_.

To send data to InfluxDB, we need parameters to access to InfluxDB storage:

* **http_server_address**: IP address of the storage
* **http_server_port**: 8086 by default
* **http_server_protocol**: http or https
* **influx_database**: name of database
* **influx_user**: user to access to database if defined
* **influx_password**: password of user to access to database if defined

In order to not saturate the storage, we will add all events in a queue and
once its max size is reached, we will send data by bulk.

We need to define the size of the queue and the maximum
delay before sending events:

* max_buffer_size
* max_buffer_age

To create this queue, we introduce a code a little more complicated. We
construct an object **event_queue**. It is composed of parameters such as
*events*, *influx_database* and methods like *new()*, *add()*.

To understand how to create such an object in Lua, we recommend the Lua
documentation `here for classes <https://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html>`_
and `there for metatables <https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html>`_.

To send data to a server, we provide a **broker_tcp_socket** object.

Its API is very simple (too simple?). This *socket*
is a TCP socket, it does not support encryption and it can be tricky to send
data in http. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: lua

  -- Here, we create our socket
  local socket = broker_tcp_socket.new()

  -- We establish the connection with the server
  socket:connect(address, port)

  -- Now, we can send data
  socket:write("This is a text to send")

  -- If, we want an answer, we also have a function to read
  local content = socket:read()

  -- When exchanges are finished, we can close the socket
  socket:close()

For our purpose, we do not use **broker_tcp_socket** because of its limitations.
We want to be able to send data to an https server.

A prerequisite is to install the `lua-socket library <http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/>`_. This library provides several functionalities, we
need two of them:

* http socket
* ltn12

To access them, Lua provides the **require** function.

Let's introduce the beginning of our new Stream Connector.

The queue parameters
====================

.. code-block:: lua

  -- We declare the objects to import here
  local http = require("socket.http")
  local ltn12 = require("ltn12")

  -- Here are predefined queue parameters
  local event_queue = {
    __internal_ts_last_flush    = nil,
    http_server_address         = "",
    http_server_port            = 8086,
    http_server_protocol        = "http",
    events                      = {},
    influx_database             = "mydb",
    influx_user                 = "",
    influx_password             = "",
    max_buffer_size             = 5000,
    max_buffer_age              = 5
  }


In this table, we give default values to parameters that can possibly
be changed during the **init()** call. This table will be used to store important
data for the script and is also our queue object.

A method to create the queue
============================

To declare this table as a Lua object, we need a constructor. So, here it is:

.. code-block:: lua

  -- Constructor of the event_queue
  function event_queue:new(o, conf)
    o = o or {}
    setmetatable(o, self)
    self.__index = self
    for i,v in pairs(conf) do
      if self[i] and i ~= "events" and string.sub(i, 1, 11) ~= "__internal_" then
        broker_log:info(1, "event_queue:new: getting parameter " .. i .. " => " .. v)
        self[i] = v
      else
        broker_log:warning(1, "event_queue:new: ignoring parameter " .. i .. " => " .. v)
      end
    end
    self.__internal_ts_last_flush = os.time()
    broker_log:info(2, "event_queue:new: setting the internal timestamp to " .. self.__internal_ts_last_flush)
    return o
  end

.. note::
   In this function, we use a Lua sugar "o = o or {}" that means *o* stays the
   same if it is **true**, otherwise it is affected with an empty table `{}`.

   Another point to notice is the **~=** operator that means **different from**.

   And to finish on this function, the variable **self** is implicitly defined
   when we declare an object's method. Its meaning is the same as **this** in
   Java or in C++. It represents the object we are working on.

A method to add event in queue
==============================

We have a queue object. It would be great to use it like this:

.. code-block:: lua

  -- We construct it
  local queue = event_queue:new(nil, conf)

  -- We add an event to it
  queue:add(event)

  -- When the queue is full, we would like to do something like this
  queue:flush()


Let's do it! Below, we present an **add()** method that retrieves a host name
and service description from the cache, builds a string from the event and
pushes it on its stack.

.. code-block:: lua

  function event_queue:add(e)
    local metric = e.name
    -- time is a reserved word in influxDB so I rename it
    if metric == "time" then
      metric = "_" .. metric
    end

    -- retrieve objects names instead of IDs
    local host_name = broker_cache:get_hostname(e.host_id)
    local service_description = broker_cache:get_service_description(e.host_id, e.service_id)

    -- what if we could not get them from cache
    if not host_name then
      broker_log:warning(1, "event_queue:add: host_name for id " .. e.host_id .. " not found. Restarting centengine should fix this.")
      host_name = e.host_id
    end
    if not service_description then
      broker_log:warning(1, "event_queue:add: service_description for id " .. e.host_id .. "." .. e.service_id .. " not found. Restarting centengine should fix this.")
      service_description = e.service_id
    else
      service_description = service_description:gsub(" ", "_")
    end

    -- we finally append the event to the events table
    metric = metric:gsub(" ", "_")
    broker_log:info(3, 'event_queue:add: adding  ' .. service_description .. ",host=" .. host_name .. " " .. metric .. "=" .. e.value .. " " .. e.ctime .. '000000000" to event list.')
    self.events[#self.events + 1] = service_description .. ",host=" .. host_name .. " " .. metric .. "=" .. e.value .. " " .. e.ctime .. "000000000\n"

    -- then we check whether it is time to send the events to the receiver and flush
    if #self.events >= self.max_buffer_size then
      broker_log:info(2, "event_queue:add: flushing because buffer size reached " .. self.max_buffer_size .. " elements.")
      self:flush()
      return true
    elseif os.time() - self.__internal_ts_last_flush >= self.max_buffer_age then
      broker_log:info(2, "event_queue:add: flushing " .. #self.events .. " elements because buffer age reached " .. (os.time() - self.__internal_ts_last_flush) .. "s and max age is " .. self.max_buffer_age .. "s.")
      self:flush()
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

A method to flush the queue
===========================

Once the events added in the queue and the maximum size of the queue or the
timeout is reached, events will be sent to the InfluxDB storage.

This function builds data from the queue and sends them to the storage. If an
error occurs, it dumps a log error.

It is here that we use the **http** and **ltn12** objects loaded at the
beginning of the script.

.. code-block:: lua

  function event_queue:flush()
    broker_log:info(2, "event_queue:flush: Concatenating all the events as one string")
    --  we concatenate all the events
    local http_post_data = ""
    local http_result_body = {}
    for i, raw_event in ipairs(self.events) do
      http_post_data = http_post_data .. raw_event
    end
    broker_log:info(2, 'event_queue:flush: HTTP POST request "' .. self.http_server_protocol .. "://" .. self.http_server_address .. ":" .. self.http_server_port .. "/write?db=" .. self.influx_database .. '"')
    broker_log:info(3, "event_queue:flush: HTTP POST data are: '" .. http_post_data .. "'")

    -- build url
    local influxdb_url = self.http_server_protocol .. "://" .. self.http_server_address .. ":" .. self.http_server_port .. "/write?db=" .. self.influx_database
    -- add authentication if needed
    if string.len(self.influx_user) >= 1 and string.len(self.influx_password) >= 1 then
      influxdb_url = influxdb_url .. "&u=" .. self.influx_user .. "&p="..self.influx_password
    end

    local hr_result, hr_code, hr_header, hr_s = http.request{
      url = influxdb_url,
      method = "POST",
      -- sink is where the request result's body will go
      sink = ltn12.sink.table(http_result_body),
      -- request body needs to be formatted as a LTN12 source
      source = ltn12.source.string(http_post_data),
      headers = {
        -- mandatory for POST request with body
        ["content-length"] = string.len(http_post_data)
      }
    }
    -- Handling the return code
    if hr_code == 204 then
      broker_log:info(2, "event_queue:flush: HTTP POST request successful: return code is " .. hr_code)
    else
      broker_log:error(1, "event_queue:flush: HTTP POST request FAILED: return code is " .. hr_code)
      for i, v in ipairs(http_result_body) do
        broker_log:error(1, "event_queue:flush: HTTP POST request FAILED: message line " .. i .. ' is "' .. v .. '"')
      end
    end

    -- now that the data has been sent, we empty the events array
    self.events = {}
    -- and update the timestamp
    self.__internal_ts_last_flush = os.time()
  end

The init() function to get parameters and create the queue
==========================================================

In this case, the **init()** function creates the queue with parameters
defined by users in the web interface or uses default parameters already
defined in the queue. This alternative is managed by the queue constructor.

.. code-block:: lua

  function init(conf)
    broker_log:set_parameters(1, "/var/log/centreon-broker/stream-connector-influxdb.log")
    broker_log:info(2, "init: Beginning init() function")
    queue = event_queue:new(nil, conf)
    broker_log:info(2, "init: Ending init() function, Event queue created")
  end

.. note::

  **queue** is not defined as local, this is important so that it is accessible
  from all the functions.

The write() function to insert events in queue
==============================================

The **write()** function is only used to insert filtered events into the queue:

.. code-block:: lua

  function write(e)
    broker_log:info(3, "write: Beginning write() function")
    queue:add(e)
    broker_log:info(3, "write: Ending write() function\n")
    return true
  end

The filter() function to select only performance data events
============================================================

To select only performance data, we need to select *category* 3 (“Storage”)
and *element* 1 for *metric*:

.. code-block:: lua

  function filter(category, element)
    if category == 3 and element == 1 then
      return true
    end
    return false
  end
