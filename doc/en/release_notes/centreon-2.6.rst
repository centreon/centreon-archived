Compatibility with PHP 5.4.x

Centreon is now compatible with PHP in version 5.4.x. So, you do not need to downgrade to PHP 5.3.x version when you install it on Debian 6, Ubuntu 13.04, RedHat 7 and CentOS 7.

- Skip trap for hosts in downtime ;
- Add custom code execution ;
- Put unknown trap in another file. 

ACL and configuration modification with admin users
###################################################

ACL management has been improved to allow for a greater number of simultaneous sysadmin users to work on the same monitoring platform.

The synchronization is more efficient in configuration page between admin and normal users.

Partial rebuild of events information
#####################################

Before, you had to rebuild from the beginning of the related data. 

Criticality inheritance
