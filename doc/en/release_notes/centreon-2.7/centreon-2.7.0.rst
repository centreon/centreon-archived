* Changing the timezone system : DST management (may need to check the timezones of each host and contact after the update)
* Changing databases schemes for hostgroups and servicegroups in the real state database (centreon_storage) : added id and deletion of alias, url, url note, icon.
* Changing the path for generating the configuration of Centreon Engine instances : no more specific page to generate the configuration. The action is now available from the pollers list.
* Switching to InnoDB all Centreon tables (except logs and data_bin too big for an automatic update).
* PHP 5.1 no longer supported
* Browser compatibility : IE 11, FF 5 et Chrome 39 at least
* Shared views in custom views are not automatically loaded in views of others users. Now views are able to be public and user can load them during the creation step.

Security fixes

* Integration of a CSRF token in all forms to prevent "Man in the middle" effect.

Removed Features
-----------------

* Removing centstorage and logAnalyser executables.
* Removing the Nagios configurations load module.
* Removing the ability to configure the colors of graphics templates
* Removing color choices for menus
* Removing choosing colors for monitoring status
* Removing the ability to configure Nagios CGI
* Transformation of the tactical overview in widget
* Transformation of the Monitoring Engine statistics Page in widget
* Deleting the Server Status page (phpsysinfo) become incompatible with the PHP version recommended for Centreon
* Remove timeperiod exclusions in the UI. This function don't work very fine whether with Centreon Engine 1.x or Nagios. We prefer removing the function in order to avoid problems.

Known Bugs
----------
* ACL of pages is not fully updated during the upgrade process. So please check all your ACL pages after the migration. You may have problems with the followings pages:

 * Monitoring > Hosts
 * Monitoring > Services
 * Monitoring > Performances (new page)
 * Monitoring > Downtimes
 * Monitoring > Comments
 * Monitoring > Eventlogs > System logs

* Graph slip not working
* Pagination is broker when you go on the last page, change the number of line to the Max. Page become empty.
* If you have timeperiods used in exception or inclusion of timeperiod and now deleted, their ids stays in the database in relation table. During the sql update process, this blocks an addition of constraint on this relation table. To fix it, you have to remove old timeperiod id.::

    mysql> DELETE FROM timeperiod_exclude_relations WHERE timeperiod_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod) OR timeperiod_exclude_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod);
    mysql> DELETE FROM timeperiod_include_relations WHERE timeperiod_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod) OR timeperiod_exclude_id NOT IN (SELECT tp_id FROM timeperiod);
