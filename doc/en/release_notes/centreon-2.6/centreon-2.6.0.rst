What's new?
***********

Compatibility with PHP 5.4.x
============================

Centreon is now compatible with PHP in version 5.4.x. So, you do not need to downgrade to PHP 5.3.x version when you install it on Debian 6, Ubuntu 13.04, RedHat 7 and CentOS 7.

Centreon proprietary module (Centreon BAM, Centreon BI, Centreon MAP, Centreon KB) is not compatible as yet with this PHP version.


New options for Centreontrapd
=============================

It's now possible with Centreontrapd to :

- Filter services on same host ;
- Transform output (to remove pipe for example) ;
- Skip trap for hosts in downtime ;
- Add custom code execution ;
- Put unknown trap in another file. 


ACL and configuration modification with admin users
===================================================

ACL management has been improved to allow for a greater number of simultaneous sysadmin users to work on the same monitoring platform.

The synchronization is more efficient in configuration page between admin and normal users.


Partial rebuild of events information
=====================================

It's now possible to partially rebuild events information with eventsRebuild script. You can now use option '-s' when rebuilding and the rebuild will start from this date.

Before, you had to rebuild from the beginning of the related data. 


Criticality inheritance
=======================

Centreon 2.6 introduces a capability for the dependent services of a host to automatically inherit its configured criticality.  Itâ€™s also possible to define the levels of global critically of a particular host and dependent services cluster thanks to the use of templates.


Integration of Centreon new logo
================================

The new Centreon logo has been integrated into this new version.
