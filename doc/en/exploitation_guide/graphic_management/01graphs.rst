Centreon can be used to generate graphs from monitoring information. There are two types of graph:

* Performance graphs serve to view the evolution of services intuitively. E.g.: filling level of a hard disc, network traffic, etc.
* History graphs (or status graphs) serve to view the evolution of the statuses of a service.

Performance graphs always have a time period for the x-axis and a unit as the y-axis (Volts, Octets, etc.). History graphs always have a time period for the x-axis, their y-axes do not vary. Only the color of the graph can be used to view the status of the object:

* Green for OK status 
* Orange for WARNING status
* Red for CRITICAL status
* Grey for UNKNOWN status

Performance graphs
==================

There are several ways to view performance graphs:

* Viewing the graph in the list of services (**Monitoring > Status Details > Services**) by mouse-over the icon |column-chart|
* Viewing the graph from the page of details of an object by clicking on **View graphs for host**
* Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Performances** to view multiple graphs

Status graphs
=============

In the same way as for the performance graphs, there are several ways of accessing status history graphs:

* From the detail page of an object (see the chapter covering :ref:`real time monitoring <realtime_monitoring>`)
* From the menu: **Monitoring > Performances**, by first selecting a specific service and then checking the **Display Status** box.

Viewing multiple graphs
=======================

To view all graphs, go into the menu: **Monitoring > Performances**.

All the filter on the top of the page allow you to select the graph you want on the period you want.

The option **Hosts** show all graphs to all hosts linked.

The option **Services** show only graph of the selected services.

The option **Graph Period** can be used to select the time period over which we want to view the graphs.  The drop-down list can be used to select predefined time periods. 

It is possible to choose the time period manually using the fields **From** and **To**, this replaces the predefined selection.

Several actions are possible on the graphs:

* **Split components**: separates multiple curves of a graph into multiple graphs each containing one curve
* **Display Status**: Displays the history graphs linked to performance graphs displayed

To use the data from graphs, it is possible to:

* View the performance graph on one day, one week, one month or one year by clicking on the performance graphs of your choice
* Back-up the graph by clicking on the icon |save|
* Download all the data contained in the graph in the .csv format by clicking on the icon |text_binary_csv|
