Monitoring management
=====================

***********************
Acknowledging a problem
***********************

Principle
=========

When a host or a service presents an incident and this incident is confirmed, the notification process is triggered, it can generate a notification sent to a contact.
If the problem persists and depending on the configuration produced (resend a notification at regular time intervals, escalation of notification, etc.) it is possible that other alerts be send.

The acknowledgment of an incident can be used to stop the notification process (sending of notifications) until the host or the service recovers its nominal status.

Example of use:

A service is charged with checking the health of the hard disks in a disc array.
A hard disk goes down on a disk array, a notification is sent.
The supervision operator acknowledges the service specifying that a team is in the process of dealing with the problem.
Notifications are no longer sent. The service will return to its nominal state after a change of disk.

.. note::
   The acknowledgment of an incident signifies the taking into account of the problem by a user of the supervision (and not the correction of the incident which can only be effective when the check returns to its nominal state).

Practice
========

To acknowledge an incident, there are two solutions:

From real time monitoring
-------------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Status Details > Hosts** (or **services**)
#. Select the object(s) that you want acknowledge
#. In the menu: **More actions** click on **Hosts: Acknowledge** or on **Services: Acknowledge**

The following window appears:

.. image :: /images/guide_exploitation/acknowledged.png
   :align: center

* If the **Sticky** box is checked, the acknowledgment will be maintained in case of a change of Not-OK status (E.g.: DOWN to REACHABLE or WARNING to CRITICAL). Otherwise, the acknowledgment disappears and the notification process is reactivated.
* If the **Notify** box is checked, a notification is sent to the contacts linked to the object to warn that the incident on the resource has been acknowledged (in the situation the contact possesses the activity acknowledgment notification filter).
* If the **Persistent** box is checked, the acknowledgment will be maintained in the case of a restart of the scheduler. Otherwise, the acknowledgment disappears and the notification process is reactivated.
* The **Comment** field is generally used to provide the reason of the acknowledgment, it is mandatory
* If the **Acknowledge services attached to hosts** box is checked, all the services linked to the host will be acknowledged (option visible only if we acknowledge a host).
* If the **Force active checks** box is checked, a command will be sent to the scheduler to recheck the resource as soon as possible.

To delete the acknowledgment of an incident on an object:

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Status Details > Hosts** (or **services**)
#. Select  the objects you want to delete the acknowledgment
#. In the menu: **More actions**, click on **Hosts: Disacknowledge** or on **Services: Disacknowledge**

From the detailed sheet of an object
------------------------------------

From of the detail page of an object, click on the icon |enabled| associated with the **Acknowledged** field in the **Options** frame

You will access the dedicated page enabling you to acknowledge the incident.

.. note::
   The fields are identical to the window obtained from the real time monitoring menu.

***********
Add comment
***********

Principle
=========

Centreon allows us to add comments on an object. This Comment is visible by anyone having access to the resource (host or service).
A comment has the following properties:

* Hostname
* Servicename if the comment is associated with a service
* Date of entry of the comment
* Author of the comment
* The contents of the comment
* The validity of the comment against a restart of the scheduler

Practice
========

There are two solutions to add a comment:

From the detailed sheet of an object
------------------------------------

#. Access to the details page of the object
#. In the category **Host/Service Commands**, click on **Add a comment for this host/this service**

From the Comment menu
---------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Downtimes > Comments**
#. Click on **Add a Service Comment** or **Add a Host Comment**

Attributes
----------

The following window appears:

.. image :: /images/guide_exploitation/comment.png
   :align: center

* The **Host Name** field defines the host concerned by the comment.
* If you have chosen to add a comment to a **Service**, the Service field can be used to select the service concerned by the comment.
* If the **Persistent** box is checked, the comment will be maintained in the event of a restart of the scheduler.
* The **Comments** field contains the comment itself.

*****************************
Programming a downtime period
*****************************

Principle
=========

A downtime period is a time period during which the notifications to a resource are disabled.
Downtimes period are used during a programmed maintenance operation, they save us receiving false-positive alerts.

.. note::
   It is important to select the all the resources necessary to prevent false-positives and false-negatives. In addition, the time spent in this state is taken into account during the generation of the availability data.

There are two types of downtime:

* The **fixed** downtime: it starts and stops at the preview time.
* The **flexible** downtime: it starts during the preview time window as soon as an incident is detected and finishes when preview time in seconds expires.

Practice
========

There are three different possibilities to define a downtime:

* From the detail sheets of a host or of the service
* From the real time monitoring interface
* From the **Downtime** menu

From the detailed sheet of an object
------------------------------------

#. Access the detail page of an object
#. In the category: **Commands**, click on **Schedule downtime for this host/service**

From real time monitoring
-------------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Status Details > Hosts** (or **services**)
#. Select  the(s) object(s) on which you want to program a downtime period
#. In the menu: More actions..., click on **Hosts : Set Downtime** or **Services : Set Downtime**

From the Downtime menu
----------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Downtimes > Downtimes**
#. Click on **Add a service downtime** or **Add a host downtime**

Attributes
----------

* The **Host Name** field defines the host concerned by the downtime
* The **Service** field defines the service concerned by the downtime
* If the **Fixed** box is checked the downtime is fixed. Otherwise, it is flexible
* If the downtime is flexible, the **Duration** field defines the length of the downtime
* The **Start Time** and **End Time** fields define the beginning and end date of the downtime
* The **Comments** field can be used to indicate why the downtime is defined

********************
Management of checks
********************

Principle
=========

It is possible to temporarily enable or disable check on a host or a service.

.. warning::
   Changes to settings checks do not affect the configuration of the object in the database. These changes are made on the supervision in real time, they are canceled if the scheduler is restarted.

Practice
========

From the detailed sheet of an object
------------------------------------

#. Access the details page of the object
#. In the category: **Options** go to the line: **Active checks** to check the state of the checks.

To:

* Enable the check, click on |enabled|
* Disable the check, click on |disabled|

From real time monitoring
-------------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Status Details > Hosts** (or **services**)
#. Select the object(s) on which you want to enable or disable the check
#. In the menu: **More actions...** click on:

* **Hosts : Disable Check** or **Services: Disable Check** to stop the check on a host or a service
* **Hosts: Enable Check** or **Services: Enable Check** to enable the check of a host or of a service

*******************
Submitting a result
*******************

Principle
=========

For passively checked services, it is possible send a result manually to the scheduler so that it is taken into account.

Practice
========

To submit a result, access the details page of the object. In the category **Service Commands** click on **Submit result for this service**

Attributes
----------

* The **Host Name** and **Service** fields define the host and the service the result will be submitted
* The **Check result** field defines the status of the service
* The **Check output** field defines the message to be displayed for the service
* The **Performance data** field can be used to define performance data for the generation of graphs

***************************
Management of notifications
***************************

Principle
=========

It is possible to temporarily enable or disable the notification of a host or a service.

.. warning::
   Changes the notifications settings do not affect the configuration of the object in the database. These changes are made on the real time monitoring, they are canceled if the scheduler is restarted.

Practice
========

There are two ways of managing the notifications:

From the detailed sheet of an object
------------------------------------

#. Access the details page of the object
#. In the category: **Options** go to the line: **Service Notifications**

To:

* Enable the notification, click on |enabled|
* Disable the notification, click on |disabled|

From real time monitoring
-------------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Status Details > Hosts** (or **services**)
#. Select the host(s) / service(s) you want enable or disable the notification
#. In the menu: **More actions...** click on:

* **Hosts: Disable Notification** or **Services: Disable Notification** to stop the notification of a host or of a service
* **Hosts: Enable Notification** or **Services: Enable Notification** to enable the notification of a host or a service

********************
Reprogramming checks
********************

Principle
=========

By default, the checks (checks on a service) are executed at regular intervals following the configuration defined by the user.
It is possible to interact on the check scheduling pile to change the programming of the checks.

There are two types of programming:

* Normal programming: the service check is given priority in the scheduler queue (asap).
* Forced programming: the service check is given priority in the scheduler queue (asap) even if the time of the execution request is outside the check period or if the service is not of the active type.

Practice
========

There are two ways of forcing the check of a service:

From the detailed sheet of the object
-------------------------------------

#. Access the detail page of the object
#. In the category **Host Commands** (or **Service Commands**), click on **Re-schedule the next check for this host / service** or **Re-schedule the next check for this host / service (forced)**

From real time monitoring
-------------------------

#. Go into the menu: **Monitoring > Status Details > Hosts** (or **services**)
#. Select the objects to for which you want to force the check
#. In the menu: **More actions...** click on **Schedule immediate check** or **Schedule immediate check (Forced)**
