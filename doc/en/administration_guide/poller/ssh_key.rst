----------------
SSH Key exchange
----------------

The communication between a central server and a poller server is done by SSH.

You should exchange the SSH keys between the servers.

If you donâ€™t have any private SSH keys on the central server for the Centreon user: ::

    # su - centreon
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy this key on the new server: ::

    # su - centreon
    $ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub centreon@IP_POLLER

Go to the :ref:`Configure a server in Centreon<wizard_add_poller>`.
