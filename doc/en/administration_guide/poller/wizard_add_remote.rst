The **Database username** and **Database password** are the credentials defined
during the installation of the Remote Server.

The **Server IP address** field is of the following form: 
[(http|https)://]@IP[:(port)]. If your Remote Server is only available on HTTPS, it
is mandatory to define the HTTP method and the TCP port is this one is not the
default one.

The **Do not check SSL certificate validation** option allows to connect
to the Remote Server using self-signed SSL certificate.

The **Do not use configured proxy tp connect to this server** allows to
connect to the Remote Server without using the proxy configuration of the
Centreon Central server.

Click on **Next**.

Select the poller(s) to link to this Remote Server, then click on **Apply**:
