LDAP
****

.. note::
    If you want to use SSO for authentication, please read this :ref:`procedure <sso>`.

This part can be used to configure the connection to LDAP directories.

To add a new directory:

#. Go into the menu: **Administration > Options > LDAP**

* **Auto import users** field used to import the users of the LDAP directory automatically into Centreon. By clicking on **Import users manually**, you can chose the users that you want to import

.. note::
   If the **Auto import users** option is checked, the LDAP settings of any new user who logs into the Centreon interface will automatically be imported into Centreon (name, first name, e-mail address, etc.). ACL profiles will be applied on access (link to :ref:`ACL <acl>`). However, if this option is not checked, only the users imported manually will be able to authenticate.

* **LDAP search size limit** field can be used to limit the size of user searches.

* **Enable LDAP synchronization on login** If enabled, a user LDAP synchronization will be performed on login to update contact's data and calculate new Centreon ACLs.
* **LDAP synchronization interval (in hours)** Displayed only if the previous option is enabled. This field is used to specify the time between two LDAP synchronization.

.. note::

   The contact's LDAP data won't be updated in Centreon until the next synchronization is expected. If needed, "on-demand" synchronization are available from the **Administration > Session** page and from the **Configuration > Users > Contact / Users** list.

   The interval is expressed in hours. By default, this field is set to the lower value : 1 hour.

.. note::
   We save a timestamp as reference date in the DB and use the CentAcl CRON to update it.

   The reference date is used to calculate the next expected LDAP synchronization.

   If you modify one of these two fields the reference timestamp will be reset to your current time.

   The reference date won't be updated if you modify or not, only the other fields / options.

   Before any import, check the default settings proposed. If you have not selected a Model, you will need to define the search filters manually by filling in the fields.

.. note::
    You can use **Okta** as LDAP server with `SWA plugin <https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_Configure_Template_App.htm>`_.
    Please define:
    
    * **uid=<USER>,dc=<ORGANIZATION>,dc=okta,dc=com** for **Bind DN** field
