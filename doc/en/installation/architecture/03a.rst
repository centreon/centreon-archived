===================
Simple architecture
===================

***********
Description
***********

The simple architecture is to have all oversight entities within the same server, ie:

* Centreon web interface
* Databases (MySQL + RRD)
* Monitoring Engine
* Broker

This architecture is the simplest a user may encounter.

**********
Components
**********

Many components are used to build this architecture:

* Apache web server for Centreon web interface
* MariaDB databases to store Centreon configuration parameters as well as monitoring and performance data
* A monitoring engine to collect data
* Collected data are sent to Centreon Broker SQL using cbmod by monitoring engine
* Centreon Broker SQL allows to store information into MariaDB databases and forward them to Centreon Broker RRD
* Centreon Broker RRD generates and updates RRD files with data in order to display performance graphs
