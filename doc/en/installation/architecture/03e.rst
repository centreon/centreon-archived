===========================================
Distributed architecture with Remote server
===========================================

Centreon Remote Server is a new building-block in the Centreon distributed
monitoring architecture. It comes in addition to the existing Centreon Central
Server and Centreon Pollers.

Centreon Remote Server allows remote IT operations team to benefit from the full
Centreon user experience, albeit on a subset of Centreon Pollers. Monitoring
configuration takes place on the Central Server and is automatically synchronized
with all Remote Servers. Monitoring Operations (Acknowledge, Downtime...) may
take place both on a Remote Server or the Central Server.

In case of network link failure between a Remote Server and the Central Server,
data retention takes place and the two Servers are synchronized as soon as the
connection is up again.

Centreon Remote Server is integrated in Centreon Core. It fully replaces the 
Poller Display module.

***********
Description
***********

The distributed architecture with Remote sever is to have three types of entities:

* A Centreon Central server to configure monitoring and to display & operate on collected data
* One or more Centreon Remote server to display & operate on a subset of collected data
* One or more pollers to collect data

The central Centreon server includes the following items:

* Centreon web interface(configure, display & operate)
* Monitoring Engine
* Broker
* Databases (MySQL + RRD)

The Remote servers include the following items:

* Centreon web interface (display & operate a subset of data)
* Monitoring Engine
* Databases (MySQL + RRD)
* Broker module to forward collected data to a central broker

This architecture is used for:

* Enable load balancing across multiple remote monitoring servers
* Network streams isolation: if your monitoring architecture has to monitor a DMZ area, it is easier (and safe) to place a remote server in the DMZ network
* Have dedicated webinterface to display & operate on a subset of data.

Components
**********

Central Centreon server
=======================

Many components are used to build a Centreon server:

* Apache web server for Centreon web interface
* MariaDB databases to store Centreon configuration parameters as well as monitoring and performance data
* The Centcore process is used to send monitoring configuration to the remote server and to manage it
* A monitoring engine to collect data
* Collected data are sent to Centreon Broker SQL using cbmod by monitoring engine
* Centreon Broker SQL allows to store information into MariaDB databases and forward them to Centreon Broker RRD
* Centreon Broker RRD generates and updates RRD files with data in order to display performance graphs

Remote monitoring server
========================

Many components are used to build a remote server:

* Apache web server for Centreon web interface
* MariaDB databases to store monitoring and performance data
* The Centcore process is used to operate on collected data
* A monitoring engine to collect data
* Collected data are sent to Centreon Broker SQL using cbmod by monitoring engine
* Centreon Broker SQL allows to store information into MariaDB databases and forward them to Centreon Broker RRD locally. All information are forwarded to the Centreon central server.
* Centreon Broker RRD generates and updates RRD files with data in order to display performance graphs

Poller
======

Many components are used to build a poller:

* A monitoring engine to collect data
* Collected data are sent to Centreon Broker SQL using cbmod by monitoring engine
