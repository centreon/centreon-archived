Examples of architectures
=========================

Centreon allows several choices in the composition of the architecture of your
monitoring tool. In a relatively simple architecture with a server hosting all
services, the architecture can also be organized around a strategic division that
distributes the load over multiple collection servers with the establishment of
collection points across multiple continents.

You will find here all architectures supported.
