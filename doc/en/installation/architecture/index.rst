Examples of architectures
=========================

Centreon allows several choices in the composition of the architecture of your monitoring tool. In a relatively simple architecture with a server hosting all services, the architecture can also be organized around a strategic division that distributes the load over multiple collection servers with the establishment of collection points across multiple contninents.

You will find here all architectures supported by this version 2.8 of the interface.
