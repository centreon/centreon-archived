Distributed architecture
========================

***********
Description
***********

The distributed architecture is to have two types of entities:

* A central Centreon server to display information
* One or more remote servers to collect data

The central Centreon server includes the following items:

* Centreon web interface
* Databases (MySQL + RRD)
* Monitoring Engine
* Broker

The Poller includes the following items:

* Monitoring Engine
* Broker module to forward collected data to a central broker

This architecture is used for:

* Enable load balancing across multiple remote monitoring servers
* Network streams isolation: if your monitoring architecture have to monitor a DMZ area, it is easier (and safe) to place a remote server in the DMZ network

Components

Central Centreon server
=======================

Many components are used to build a central Centreon server:

* Apache web server for Centreon web interface
* MariaDB databases to store Centreon configuration parameters as well as monitoring and performance data
* The Centcore process is used to send monitoring configuration to the remote server and to manage it
* A monitoring engine to collect data
* Collected data are sent to Centreon Broker SQL using cbmod by monitoring engine
* Centreon Broker SQL allows to store information into MariaDB databases and forward them to Centreon Broker RRD
* Centreon Broker RRD generates and updates RRD files with data in order to display performance graphs

Poller
======

Many components are used to build a poller:

* A monitoring engine to collect data
* Collected data are sent to Centreon Broker SQL using cbmod by monitoring engine
