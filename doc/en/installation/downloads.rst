Open Source software supplied by Centreon is generally available in 4 formats:

* ISO Linux based on CentOS v7 distribution (recommended)
* RPM packages available for CentOS v7 distribution (recommended)
* virtual machines, based on CentOS v7 distribution, with OVA (VMware) and OVF (VirtualBox and others) formats
* Archives containing the sources

RPM packages and ISO linux are the best format to obtain our software. They are 
packaged by Centreon experts and relieve you of any concern over the installation
process.

.. note::
    Centreon recommends using the Centreon packaged version. Installation is detailed
    in the chapter entitled: :ref:`Using Centreon<installisoel7>`

If your platform does not support RPM packages, you should use archives containing
the sources of stable versions of our software and install them manually. Manual
compilation of some packages can be complex.

For downloading Centreon sources, please refer to our `website
