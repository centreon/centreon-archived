The chapter describes the installation of a Centreon central server.

Perform the command:

 ::

  $ yum install centreon-base-config-centreon-engine centreon


After this step you should connect to Centreon to finalise the installation process.
This step is described :ref:`here <installation_web_ces>`.

Installing a poller
-------------------

This chapter describes the installation of a collector.

Perform the command:

 ::

 $ yum install centreon-poller-centreon-engine

Add GPG key for CentOS 6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You also have to recover the GPG key and place it in the rpm-gpg file.

Perform the command:

 ::

   $ cd /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
   $ wget http://yum-1.centreon.com/standard/3.4/el6/stable/RPM-GPG-KEY-CES

Add GPG key for CentOS 7
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You also have to recover the GPG key and place it in the rpm-gpg file.

Perform the command:

 ::

   $ cd /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
   $ wget http://yum-1.centreon.com/standard/3.4/el7/stable/RPM-GPG-KEY-CES

Install mysql on the same server
--------------------------------

Ce chapitre décrit l'installation de mysql sur un serveur comprenant Centreon.
This chapter describes the installation of mysql on a server including Centreon.

Perform the command:

  ::

   $ yum install mariadb-server
   $ service mysql restart

Base configuration of a poller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The communication between a central server and a poller server is by SSH.

You should exchange the SSH keys between the servers.

If you don’t have any private SSH keys on the central server for the Centreon user:

 ::

 $ su - centreon
 $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy this key on the collector:

 ::

 $ ssh-copy-id centreon@your_poller_ip


.. _installation_web:

Any operating system
--------------------

Disable SELinux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SELinux should be disabled; for this, you have to modify the file "/etc/sysconfig/selinux" and replace "enforcing" by "disabled":

::

    SELINUX=disabled

PHP timezone
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PHP timezone should be set; go to /etc/php.d directory and create a file named php-timezone.ini who contain the following line :

::

    date.timezone = Europe/Paris

After saving the file, please don't forget to restart apache server.

Firewall
^^^^^^^^

Add firewall rules or disable it. To disable it execute folowwing commands:

* **iptables** (CentOS v6) ::

    # /etc/init.d/iptables save
    # /etc/init.d/iptables stop
    # chkconfig iptables off

* **firewalld** (CentOS v7) ::

    # systemctl stop firewalld
    # systemctl disable firewalld
    # systemctl status firewalld

DataBase Management System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mysql database server should be available to complete installation (locally or not). MariaDB is recommended.

For CentOS / RHEL in version 7, it is necessary to modify **LimitNOFILE** limitation.
Edit **/etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service** file and change ::

    LimitNOFILE=32000

Save the file and execute the folowwing commands::

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # service mysqld restart

Easy monitoring configuration
*****************************

Centreon is great in itself, highly versatile  and can be configured to
fit the very specifics of your monitored infrastructure. However you
might find useful to use Centreon IMP to get you started in minutes.
Centreon IMP provides you Plugin Packs which are bundled configuration
templates that highly reduce the time needed to properly monitor the
most common services of your network.

Centreon IMP needs the technical components Centreon License Manager
and Centreon Plugin Pack Manager to work.

Install packages
----------------

When using CES, installation of Centreon Plugin Pack Manager is very
easy. You'll see that Centreon License Manager will be installed too
as a dependency.

::

   $ yum install centreon-pp-manager

Web install
-----------

Once the packages installed, you need to enable the module in Centreon.
So get to the Administration -> Extensions -> Modules page.

.. image:: /_static/images/installation/ppm_1.png
   :align: center

Install Centreon License Manager (dependency of Centreon Plugin Pack Manager) first.

.. image:: /_static/images/installation/ppm_2.png
   :align: center

Then install Centreon Plugin Pack Manager itself.

.. image:: /_static/images/installation/ppm_3.png
   :align: center

You're now ready to got to Administration -> Extensions -> Plugin packs -> Setup.
You'll find there 6 free Plugin Packs to get you started. 5 more are
available after free registration and 150+ if you subscribe to the IMP
offer (more information on `our website <https://www.centreon.com>`_).
