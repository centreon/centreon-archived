* The **Home** menu enables access to the first home screen after logging in. It summarises the general status of the supervision.
* The **Monitoring** menu contains the status of all the supervised elements in real and delayed time via the viewing of logs and performance graphics.
* The **Reporting** menu serves to view, intuitively (via diagrams), the evolution of the supervision on a given period.
* The **Configuration** menu serves to configure all monitored objects and the supervision infrastructure.
* The **Administration** menu serves to configure the Centreon web interface and to view the general status of the servers.

Before going further
====================

it is necessary update the server. To do this:

 #.	Log in as a ‘root’ on the central server
 #.	Enter this command

::

Allow the update to run fully and then restart the server in case of a kernel update.

*****************************
Easy monitoring configuration
*****************************

Centreon is great in itself, highly versatile  and can be configured to
fit the very specifics of your monitored infrastructure. However you
might find it useful to use Centreon IMP to get you started in minutes.
Centreon IMP provides you Plugin Packs which are bundled configuration
templates that highly reduce the time needed to properly monitor the
most common services of your network.

Centreon IMP needs the technical components: Centreon License Manager
and Centreon Plugin Pack Manager to work.

Install packages
----------------

When using Centreon ISO, the installation of Centreon Plugin Pack Manager is very
easy. You'll see that Centreon License Manager will be installed too
as a dependency.

::

   $ yum install centreon-pp-manager

Web install
-----------

Once the packages are installed, you need to enable the module in Centreon.
So go to the Administration -> Extensions -> Modules page.

.. image:: /_static/images/installation/ppm_1.png
   :align: center

Install Centreon License Manager (dependency of Centreon Plugin Pack Manager) first.

.. image:: /_static/images/installation/ppm_2.png
   :align: center

Then install Centreon Plugin Pack Manager itself.

.. image:: /_static/images/installation/ppm_3.png
   :align: center

You're now ready to go to Administration -> Extensions -> Plugin packs -> Setup.
You'll find there 6 free Plugin Packs to get you started. 5 more are
available after free registration and 150+ if you subscribe to the IMP
offer (more information on `our website <https://www.centreon.com>`_).
