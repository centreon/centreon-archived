Link from monitoring front end
==============================

The technical procedure is available in Centreon front-end through a
link icon:

.. image:: ../../../_static/images/knowledge/screen_host_monitoring.png
   :align: center

By clicking on link icon, the user is redirected to the corresponding
procedure. 

If the link icon is on the left of a host name, the wiki
page containing the procedure for the host will be displayed.

If the link icon is on the right of a service name, the wiki page containing
the procedure for the service will be displayed.

Synchronization
---------------

There's a cron job that updates hosts, services and hosts/services
templates configuration.

For example, if you create a page in the wiki using the usual pattern
(ex: ``Host:Centreon-Server`` or ``Service:Centreon-Server Disk-/``),

It will add the link to the page in the **URL** field of object's extented information.
