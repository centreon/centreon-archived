Notification escalation
=======================

**********
Definition
**********

Generally, if an alert is triggered, a notification serves to contact one or more contacts (or groups of contacts). In the same way it is possible to send multiple notifications at regular time intervals.

An escalation of notifications serves to contact various groups of contacts during the notifications process or to change the means of notification (replace mails by an SMS).
The definition of a notification escalation to a host, a host group, a service, a service group or a meta-service overwrites the normal configuration of notifications for this object.

E.g.: a service A is set to send notifications to a group of contacts “A” in case of Not-OK status. These notifications are sent every 5 minutes. If during a certain number of notifications sent the status of the service is still Not-OK, it is possible to contact the individuals of the group of contacts “B” etc...

Escalations of notification are convenient in the situation where level 1, level 2, level 3, etc., support level teams exist within a company. When a problem appears the level 1 support team is contacted. If after a certain time the level 1 team has not succeeded in solving the problem, the level 2 team is alerted, etc.

* The **Escalation Name** and **Alias** fields serve to define a name and an alias for the notification escalation.
* The **First Notification** field allows us to choose the notification number as of which the group of contacts is alerted.

* The **Notification Interval** field defines the notification interval between alerts.
* The **Escalation Period** field defines the notification time period.
* The **Hosts Escalation Options** and **Services Escalation Options** service escalation fields define the statuses of hosts and of services for which the escalation is used.
* The **Linked Contact Groups** defines the group of contacts to be contacted on triggering the escalation.
* The **Comments** field can be used to comment on the escalation.
