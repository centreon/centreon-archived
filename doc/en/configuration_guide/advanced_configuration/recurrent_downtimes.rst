Recurrent downtimes
===================

**********
Definition
**********

A downtime period is a time period during which the notifications to a host or a service are disabled. Downtime periods are convenient during maintenance operations on a host or a service: they allow us to avoid receiving false positive.

Recurrent Downtime periods are Downtime periods that recurs repetitively.

E.g.: A back-up of the virtual machines is performed every day from 20h00 to midnight. This type of back-up has a tendency to saturate the CPU use of all the virtual machines. It is necessary to program recurrent Downtime periods on the services concerned to avoid receiving notifications from 20h00 to midnight.

.. note::
   The Downtime periods are taken into account in the calculation of the availability ratio of the resource in the menu: "Dashboard".

Types of Downtime periods

* The **flexible** downtime period: This means that if during the time period defined the service or the host returns a Not-OK status the downtime period lasts a certain number of seconds (to be defined in the form) from the moment when the host or the status returns a Not-OK status.
