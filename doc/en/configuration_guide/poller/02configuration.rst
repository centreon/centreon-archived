#. click on **Add**

* In the **General** tab:

  * Select the **Requester**
  * Set **Name** of the configuration
  * Set **Config file name ** that should be exactly the same as the one defined in Centreon Engine configuration, for example **poller-module.xml**
  * Check the value **No** for the **Link to cbd service** option

Centreontrapd Configuration
===========================

It is necessary to change the configuration files of Centreontrapd so that the service can question the SQLite database (see the chapter: :ref:`configuration_advanced_snmptrapds`).

Plugins synchronisation
=======================

You can synchronise the plugins between your central server and your remote pollers using **rsync** software.

.. warning::
   Don’t perform this action if your plugins depend on third party libraries that need to have been installed previously.

Exchanging SSH keys
===================

For the central server to be able to export the configuration files of the monitoring engine, it is necessary to make a SSH key exchange between the central server and the new remote poller.

On the remote poller:

#. Log in as a ‘root’
#. Change the Centreon user password::

	# passwd centreon

On the central server:

1. Log in as ‘Centreon’::

    # su - centreon

2. If you have not already generated a public / private key pair, enter the following command (leave the default options)::

    $ ssh-keygen

3. Then export your SSH key to the remote poller::

    $ ssh-copy-id -i /var/spool/centreon/.ssh/id_rsa.pub centreon@[POLLER_IP]

4. Check that you can log in from the central server to the remote poller as a Centreon user. You can you use the command::

    $ ssh centreon@[POLLER_IP]

Export the configuration
========================

The final step is to export the configuration to verify that the installation of the remote poller has been executed correctly.

.. note::
   Refer to the documentation: :ref:`Export configuration<deployconfiguration>`
