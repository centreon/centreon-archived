# Note: Wildcard matches are only matched if there are NO exact matches.  This takes

#	the NODES list prevents it from being considered a match, the wildcard entry will
#	only be used if there are no other exact matches.

# SNMPTRAPD passes the IP address of device sending the trap, and the IP address of the

# (which includes the local hosts file, depending on how the OS is configured).  This name
# will be used for: NODES entry matches, hostname field in logged traps (file / database), 
# and the $A variable.  Host names on the NODES line will be resolved and the IP address 
# will then be used for comparing.
