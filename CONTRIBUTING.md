### Centreon style guides

#### Formating commit messages

The commit format should follow this commit template message
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

The format explanation can be found [here](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html).

The ***body*** section needs to be clear, made of complete sentences introducing the purpose of the commit and the context, making code reviews much easier.

The ***footer*** should contain reference(s) to the ticket(s) related to the commit.
Applied to the sample ticket
```
Refs: #5567 (GitHub) or MON-2234 (Jira)
```
The ***type*** can refer to
- **feat**: adding a feature
- **fix**: adding a patch
- **enh**: adding an enhancement
- **docs**: adding documentation changes
- **style**: fixing coding style issues
- **refactor**: code refactoring
- **test**: adding new tests or fixing old ones
- **chore** : updating project construction files (Jenkins files, CMakefile, gulp, webpack ...)

The ***scope*** is defined by project. Scopes for Centreon Open Source project can be found [here](scopes/centreon.md).

#### Coding style

Centreon software is made of several languages. For each language a specific coding style **must be respected**.

Since the 18.10 version of Centreon REACT has been introduced and Centreon follows the [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) react coding style.

For other languages, coding style rules are defined in Centreon GitHub repository
* [PHP](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/php)
* [CSS](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/css)
* [HTML](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/html)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/js)

#### Documentation
