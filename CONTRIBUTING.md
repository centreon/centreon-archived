### I have an issue to report

Before reporting an issue please make sure that it has not been already reported by checking [Centreon Bug Tracker](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/issues)

If your issue has **not** been reported yet, then the issue should be opened using the following template [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

### I have a suggestion of enhancement

Any ideas, enhancements, feature requests are more than welcome. Feature requests should be opened by using the following template [FEATURE_REQUEST.md](.github/FEATURE_REQUEST.md)

### I have a pull request to submit

You have been working on Centreon base code and want to submit it to us. Well... Again you are more than welcome and thank you in advance ! :clap:

The pull request must comply with certain requirements which are set out in the following template
[PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

> **Notice**: A pull request which contains more than the described modifications or contains more than one issue will
be rejected. Kindly write a detailed description and open one pull request per issue.

If the pull request matches the expected requirements, it will be added to a refinement session with the development team and the product owner.
If everything is clear, the pull request will be integrated to the development workflow and will be merged if it successfully passes our Continuous Integration's acceptance tests.
Afterwards, our Quality Assurance team will test it again to avoid any regressions before the pull request is released.

If the development team needs more details, they will contact you about the pull request. Please stay tuned.

> **Warning**: Any pull request that does not respect the requirements will ultimately be rejected ! In addition,
if you are asked to do so, you must help us understand your changes or behavior, and respond to us within 8 days.

> **Notice**: We used another open source project's contribution model as inspiration to provide better communication on your pull request's status :
Visual Studio Code.


Here are the labels and descriptions we may add to your work.

### Centreon style guides

#### Formating commit messages

The commit format should follow this commit template message
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

The format explanation can be found [here](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html).

The ***body*** section needs to be clear, made of complete sentences introducing the purpose of the commit and the context, making code reviews much easier.

The ***footer*** should contain reference(s) to the ticket(s) related to the commit.
Applied to the sample ticket
```
Refs: #5567 (GitHub) or MON-2234 (Jira)
```
The ***type*** can refer to
- **feat**: adding a feature
- **fix**: adding a patch
- **enh**: adding an enhancement
- **docs**: adding documentation changes
- **style**: fixing coding style issues
- **refactor**: code refactoring
- **test**: adding new tests or fixing old ones
- **chore** : updating project construction files (Jenkins files, CMakefile, gulp, webpack ...)

The ***scope*** is defined by project. Scopes for Centreon Open Source project can be found [here](scopes/centreon.md).

#### Coding style

Centreon software is made of several languages. For each language a specific coding style **must be respected**.

> **Notice**: For some languages, a bot may ask you to rework the formatting of your code. Until you make the
 modifications, we won't be able to add your work to the refinement loop.

Since the 18.10 version of Centreon REACT has been introduced and Centreon follows the [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) react coding style.

For other languages, coding style rules are defined in Centreon GitHub repository
* [PHP](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/php)
* [CSS](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/css)
* [HTML](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/html)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/tree/master/doc/coding-style/js)

#### Documentation

If you want to visualize and suggest modification to the documentation through a pull request
you can check the **HOW TO** build the documentation section [here](doc/README.md)
