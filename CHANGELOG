Changes
-------

* Important web design changes can make interface not compatible with older modules. A refactoring work will be needed to ensure optimal operation.
* Changing the timezone system : DST management (may need to check the timezones of each host and contact after the update)
* Changing databases schemes for hostgroups and servicegroups in the real state database (centreon_storage) : added id and deletion of alias, url, url note, icon.
* Changing the path for generating the configuration of Centreon Engine instances : no more specific page to generate the configuration. The action is now available from the pollers list.
* Switching to InnoDB all Centreon tables (except logs and data_bin too big for an automatic update).
* PHP 5.1 no longer supported
* Browser compatibility : IE 11, FF 5 et Chrome 39 at least
* Shared views in custom views are not atomaticaly loaded in views of others users. Now views are able to be public and user can load them during the creation step.

Secutiry fixes

* Removing PHP session ID in the URL of the Ajax flow of certain pages.
* Integration of a CSRF token in all forms to prevent "Man in the middle" effect.

* Removing centstorage and logAnalyser executables.
